# CLAUDE.md — Project Context for Agents

> **Audience:** Claude Code agents (and the orchestrator) loading this file as system context. Humans should read `README.md` first.

This is the **Evolve Framework** — a self-evolving Claude Code plugin: stack-aware scaffolding, specialist agents with explicit decision trees, 10-point confidence engine, autonomous proactivity. **Node 22+. Pure JS. No Docker. No native compilation.** See `README.md` and `docs/specs/2026-04-27-evolve-framework-design.md` for full design.

---

## Core philosophy (read first — orients every decision)

These six principles override defaults whenever they conflict with general practice:

1. **Persona over generic agents.** Every agent is a specialist with explicit decision tree, procedure, output contract, and anti-patterns. Generic helpfulness is what training data already gives — agents earn their place by being specific.
2. **Evidence over assertion.** Every claim — "X works", "Y is safe", "Z is the right approach" — must cite file:line, test output, graph evidence, or memory entry. No "trust me" outputs.
3. **Confidence-gated delivery.** Work isn't done when you stop typing — work is done when an applicable rubric scores ≥9/10. Below threshold: iterate. Override: log and explain.
4. **Memory beats re-derivation.** If a decision was made before, find it in `.claude/memory/decisions/` and cite. Re-deriving silently wastes tokens and risks contradicting past resolutions.
5. **Graph before refactor.** Public-surface changes (rename / move / extract / delete) require `--callers` evidence FIRST. The semantic RAG won't catch cross-file callers — only the graph does.
6. **Anti-half-finished discipline.** No commented-out code, no TODOs without owners, no half-applied refactors. Either complete a change or revert it cleanly.

## Memory system (`.claude/memory/`)

Five categories, each markdown with frontmatter (`id`, `type`, `date`, `tags`, `agent`, `confidence`):

| Category | When to write | Tag examples |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `decisions/` | Architecture / library / pattern choice with rationale + alternatives considered | `auth`, `db`, `queue` |
| `patterns/` | Reusable pattern established across ≥2 places (idempotency, error envelope, ...) | `idempotency`, `pagination` |
| `incidents/` | Postmortem with root cause, blast radius, and prevention measures | `outage`, `data-loss` |
| `learnings/` | Project-specific insight not obvious from code (gotchas, vendor quirks) | `stripe`, `redis-cluster` |
| `solutions/` | "How we solved X" catalog — searchable recipes | `n+1`, `auth-flow` |

**Indexing:** `memory.db` (SQLite FTS5 + e5 embeddings + per-chunk semantic). Hash-based incremental updates via `chokidar` watcher. **No truncation** — every word of every entry reachable by semantic search.

**Skill:** `evolve:project-memory` — invoke BEFORE any non-trivial task. Returns ≤5 most-relevant prior entries with file:line refs.

**Adding entries:** `evolve:add-memory` skill — writes markdown + auto-rebuilds index.

---

## Code Search (semantic + FTS5)

Hybrid **Code RAG** index at `.claude/memory/code.db`:

- **Semantic**: `Xenova/multilingual-e5-small` (RU+EN+100 langs, ~129 MB bundled offline)
- **Keyword**: SQLite FTS5 BM25 over function-aware code chunks
- **Hybrid ranking**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion (k=60) over BM25 + cosine similarity
- **Incremental**: three refresh paths (all wired, no manual intervention required):
  - **Pseudo-watcher** (always-on, no daemon): `PostToolUse` hook on `Write|Edit` re-indexes touched files into both RAG + Graph (`code.db`) AND memory FTS (`memory.db`) — covers `.ts/.py/.go/...` plus `.claude/memory/**/*.md`. Skips embeddings to stay fast (~50–500ms per file); BM25 + symbols/edges always fresh. Opt-out: `EVOLVE_HOOK_NO_INDEX=1`. Opt-in to embeddings: `EVOLVE_HOOK_EMBED=1`.
  - **mtime-scan on SessionStart** (`scripts/lib/mtime-scan.mjs`): cheap stat() over every row in `code_files` + `entries`. Detects files changed/deleted between sessions (external editor, `git pull`, CI) and reindexes/removes accordingly. Pure stat — no read unless mtime indicates a change. Output: `[evolve] mtime-scan: N reindexed, M removed`.
  - **Watcher daemon** (optional, opt-in): `npm run memory:watch` — chokidar long-running with embeddings, real-time live-reload while files churn during a session. For 99% of users the first two paths cover everything.
- **Languages**: TS, TSX, JS, JSX, Python, PHP, Rust, Go, Java, Ruby, Vue, Svelte (whole-file chunking for last two)

Skill: `evolve:code-search` — invoke **BEFORE** any non-trivial code change.

| Question | Command |
|----------|---------|
| "How does X work?" (concept) | `node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/search-code.mjs --query "<topic>"` |
| Files matching a phrase | `... --query "<phrase>" --limit 10` |
| By language | `... --query "<topic>" --lang typescript` |

Rebuild: `npm run code:index`. SessionStart hook auto-refreshes a missing index.

---

## Code Graph (structural relationships)

Beyond semantic, the same `code.db` has a **code graph** with symbols + edges:

- **Symbols**: function / class / method / type / interface / enum (per language, tree-sitter S-expression queries)
- **Edges**: `calls`, `imports`, `extends`, `implements`, `references`

| Question | Command |
|----------|---------|
| Who calls X? | `node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/search-code.mjs --callers "X"` |
| What does X depend on? | `... --callees "X"` |
| Neighborhood of X | `... --neighbors "X" --depth 2` |
| Refactor blast-radius | `--callers "X"` then `--neighbors "X" --depth 2` |
| Most-connected symbols (orientation) | `... --top-symbols 20` |
| Same-name disambiguation | pass full ID `path:kind:name:line` instead of bare name |

**Discipline (enforced by rule `use-codegraph-before-refactor`):**

- BEFORE rename / extract method / move / inline: ALWAYS run `--callers` first — caller count is your blast radius
- BEFORE deleting a public symbol: confirm `--callers <symbol>` returns 0 in addition to running tests
- Cite graph evidence in agent output via 3-case template (Case A: callers found / Case B: zero callers verified / Case C: N/A with reason). Skipping the section on a structural change FAILS the agent-delivery rubric.

**Auto-startup:** SessionStart hook prints index status as the first 3 lines of every session. If you see `code graph ✗` or `WARN`, run `npm run code:index` before depending on graph queries.

**Languages covered:** TypeScript, JavaScript, TSX, JSX, Python, PHP, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby. Vue/Svelte deferred (need multi-grammar stitching for `<script>` + `<template>`).

**Coverage realism:** ~80% cross-file edge resolution baseline (industry standard for non-LSP graph extractors). Unresolved targets surface with `to_name` and `kind=external` — useful for "imports from third-party X".

---

## Preview Server (local mockup hosting)

Design / prototype agents can spawn a local `http://localhost:NNNN` to serve generated HTML/CSS/JS with hot-reload — user opens in browser, edits propagate via SSE within ~200ms.

**When to use:** after `evolve:landing-page`, `evolve:prototype`, `evolve:interaction-design-patterns`, or any agent that produces visual output.

**Skill:** `evolve:preview-server`

**CLI:**
| Form | Action |
|------|--------|
| `node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/preview-server.mjs --root <dir>` | Start server, print URL |
| `... --list` | List running servers |
| `... --kill <port>` | Kill specific server |
| `... --kill-all` | Kill all |

**Auto-cleanup:** SessionStart prunes stale registry entries (PIDs no longer alive). SIGINT/SIGTERM cleanup on session end. Idle-shutdown after 30min of no activity (--idle-timeout configurable).

**Status:** `npm run evolve:status` shows running previews with URL/PID/age.

**Optional Playwright integration:** when MCP available, skill captures screenshot to `.claude/memory/previews/<label>-<timestamp>.png` as evidence.

**Constraints:** binds to 127.0.0.1 only (no network access); zero new deps (pure node:http + SSE).

---

## Confidence Engine

Every agent output is scored against an applicable rubric (0–10). Gate threshold: **≥9** for non-blocking acceptance, **≥8** with override allowed once-per-task with logged rationale.

**12 rubrics** (in `confidence-rubrics/*.yaml`):

| Rubric | Applies to |
|--------|-----------|
| `agent-delivery` | Any agent's task output (most common) |
| `agent-quality` | Newly authored / strengthened agent files |
| `skill-quality` | Skill markdown files |
| `rule-quality` | Rule markdown files |
| `requirements` | Requirements docs from systems-analyst |
| `plan` | Implementation plans from writing-plans skill |
| `scaffold` | Output of /evolve-genesis or stack-pack apply |
| `framework` | Foundational framework changes |
| `prototype` | Prototype-builder outputs |
| `research-output` | Research notes from *-researcher agents |
| `memory-entry` | Memory entries before persistence |
| `brandbook` | Brandbook deliverables |

**Override flow:** when a justified result scores 8.x, agent may override with `evolve:_core:quality-gate-reviewer` reviewing the rationale. Override is logged to `.claude/confidence-log.jsonl`. Override rate >5% in a 100-entry window triggers SessionStart warning.

**Skill:** `evolve:confidence-scoring` — applies the rubric and emits structured score + evidence.

---

## Agent Evolution Loop (Phase G + H)

Plugin tracks every agent invocation and detects degradation:

1. **Logger** (`scripts/lib/agent-invocation-logger.mjs`) — append-only JSONL at `.claude/memory/agent-invocations.jsonl`
2. **Hook** (`scripts/hooks/post-tool-use-log.mjs`) — wired via `PostToolUse` matcher `Task`, logs every subagent dispatch with extracted confidence score + override marker
3. **Effectiveness tracker** (`scripts/effectiveness-tracker.mjs`) — aggregates log → updates each agent's `frontmatter.effectiveness` block (iterations, last-task, last-outcome, last-applied, avg-confidence, override-rate). Runs on `Stop` hook.
4. **Underperformer detector** (`scripts/lib/underperformer-detector.mjs`) — flags agents with `avg-confidence < 8.5` OR rising override-rate trend (Δ ≥ 40% across recent window).
5. **SessionStart surface** — banner shows flagged agents + recommends `/evolve-strengthen`.
6. **Auto-strengthen trigger** (`scripts/lib/auto-strengthen-trigger.mjs`) — `/evolve-strengthen` (no args) reads suggestions, asks user confirmation, dispatches strengthen sequentially per agent with diff-gate.
7. **Re-dispatch suggester** (`scripts/lib/agent-task-store.mjs` + `scripts/lib/dispatch-suggester.mjs`) — every Task call mirrors into `.claude/memory/agent-tasks.db` (SQLite + FTS5). When a Task finishes with `confidence < 8.0` and no override, the hook queries the mirror for similar past tasks where another agent scored ≥8.5 and prints a `[evolve] dispatch-hint:` system-reminder with up to 3 alternative agents (avg score + sample task). Requires ≥3 historical samples — silent on cold-start. Threshold + sample floor configurable via the suggester's options object.

**Discipline:**
- Underperformers reviewed at every SessionStart
- Manual strengthen always wins — auto-trigger never modifies agent files without explicit user gate per diff
- Detector requires ≥10 invocations before flagging anything

**Override rate** > 5% in 100-entry window also triggers `/evolve-audit` recommendation (existing behavior).

**E2E:** `tests/evolution-loop-e2e.test.mjs` proves the loop closes (log → aggregate → detect → suggest).

---

## Canonical agent output footer (mandatory)

Every agent's last 3-5 lines MUST contain a canonical footer that the PostToolUse hook can parse:

```
Confidence: <N>.<dd>/10
Override: <true|false>
Rubric: <rubric-id-from-confidence-rubrics-dir>
```

**Why:** the evolution loop's PostToolUse hook regex-matches `Confidence: N/10` to log a score. Without the canonical format → score=0 → false underperformer flag.

**Where to put it:** as a fenced code block (preferred) or plain text inside the agent's `## Output contract` section. The agent definition file MUST include this in `## Output contract` so authors know to print it.

**For agents that legitimately can't score themselves** (e.g. pure-research read-only agents): output `Confidence: N/A` and `Rubric: read-only-research` — the regex treats `N/A` as null and skips logging.

**Validator:** `npm run validate:agent-footers` — fails build if any agent's `## Output contract` lacks a Confidence line + Rubric line.

## Agent system (79 agents)

Routing by `namespace` in frontmatter:

| Namespace | Count | Examples | When to invoke |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------------|
| `_core` | 8 | `code-reviewer`, `refactoring-specialist`, `repo-researcher`, `architect-reviewer`, `root-cause-debugger`, `security-auditor`, `quality-gate-reviewer`, `auth-architect` | Cross-cutting reviews and analyses |
| `_meta` | 3 | `evolve-orchestrator`, `memory-curator`, `rules-curator` | Maintenance + dispatch |
| `_design` | 10 | `ux-ui-designer`, `creative-director`, `ui-polish-reviewer`, `accessibility-reviewer`, `copywriter`, `prototype-builder`, `extension-ui-designer`, `electron-ui-designer`, `tauri-ui-designer`, `mobile-ui-designer` | Design surface (web + extensions + desktop + mobile) |
| `_ops` | 16 | `devops-sre`, `infrastructure-architect`, `db-reviewer`, `ai-integration-architect`, plus researchers + reviewers | Ops + research |
| `_product` | 6 | `product-manager`, `systems-analyst`, `qa-test-engineer`, `analytics-implementation`, `seo-specialist`, `email-lifecycle` | Product surface |
| `stacks/laravel` | 4 | `laravel-architect`, `laravel-developer`, `eloquent-modeler`, `queue-worker-architect` | Laravel projects |
| `stacks/nextjs` | 3 | `nextjs-architect`, `nextjs-developer`, `server-actions-specialist` | Next.js projects |
| `stacks/fastapi` | 2 | `fastapi-architect`, `fastapi-developer` | FastAPI projects |
| `stacks/react` | 1 | `react-implementer` | Standalone React/Vite |
| `stacks/postgres` | 1 | `postgres-architect` | Postgres-heavy projects |
| `stacks/redis` | 1 | `redis-architect` | Redis-heavy projects |
| `stacks/chrome-extension` | 2 | `chrome-extension-architect`, `chrome-extension-developer` | Chrome MV3 / Edge / Brave browser extensions (popup, options, side panel, content scripts, service worker) |
| `stacks/*` (other) | ~22 | django, rails, spring, vue, svelte, nuxt, ios, android, flutter, go, mongo, mysql, elasticsearch, graphql, nestjs, express, aspnet | Stack-specific architects/developers |

## Browser Feedback Channel

When `preview-server` runs (default), every served HTML page is injected with a feedback overlay. User clicks a 💬 button → selects any element → comments → comment is appended as JSONL to `.claude/memory/feedback-queue.jsonl`.

**Delivery to active Claude session:** the `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`scripts/hooks/user-prompt-submit-feedback.mjs`) drains new entries on EVERY prompt the user sends, advances the per-session cursor at `.claude/memory/feedback-cursor.json`, and emits the entries as `additionalContext` so Claude sees them inline in the prompt context. There is NO separate watcher / sidecar process — claude-code reads only its own input + hook outputs.

The skill `evolve:browser-feedback` then triages each entry → routes to `creative-director` (visual/motion) or `prototype-builder` (layout/a11y/copy) → applies minimal change → writes `prototypes/<slug>/feedback-resolutions/<id>.md`.

Disable: `node scripts/preview-server.mjs --no-feedback ...`.

Constraints: localhost-only, single-client typical, text frames only. WebSocket implemented in-process via `node:net` (no `ws` dep) — see `.claude/memory/decisions/2026-04-28-feedback-websocket.md`.

## Non-web design surfaces

`/evolve-design` Stage 0 asks user the target surface: `web` | `chrome-extension` | `electron` | `tauri` | `mobile-native`. Viewport defaults from `templates/viewport-presets/<target>.json`. Specialist designer:

- web → `ux-ui-designer` + `creative-director`
- chrome-extension → `extension-ui-designer`
- electron → `electron-ui-designer`
- tauri → `tauri-ui-designer`
- mobile-native → `mobile-ui-designer`

Same brandbook (target-aware via `templates/brandbook-target-baselines/<target>.md`) + same handoff flow with target-specific adapter (`templates/handoff-adapters/<target>.md.tpl`). Prototype runtime adapts (HTML for web/extension/electron/tauri renderers; mobile-native HTML is fidelity sketch — production = React Native / Flutter / native).

## Pre-write prototype guard

`scripts/hooks/pre-write-prototype-guard.mjs` (PreToolUse on Write|Edit) blocks writes to `prototypes/<slug>/` until `config.json` exists (forces viewport question to be asked first) AND blocks writes containing framework imports (`import … from`, `require()`, `<script src=…cdn…>`). Existing prototypes from before plan v2 — run `npm run migrate:prototype-configs` once to backfill default config.json.

**All agents:** ≥250 lines, full Persona / Project Context / Skills / Decision tree / Procedure / Output contract / Anti-patterns / Verification / Common workflows / Out of scope / Related.

**Reference template:** `agents/_core/code-reviewer.md` (260 lines) — canonical structure for new agents.

---

## Rules / discipline (20 rules)

Files in `rules/`. Each enforced by `evolve:rule-audit` skill and applies-when frontmatter.

| Rule | Severity | What it enforces |
|------|----------|------------------|
| `anti-hallucination` | critical | Cite file:line for every claim; never invent function signatures |
| `confidence-discipline` | critical | Score work; gate at ≥9; log overrides |
| `no-half-finished` | critical | No commented code, no orphan TODOs, no half-applied refactors |
| `no-dead-code` | high | Knip-clean; remove unused exports + functions |
| `no-hardcode` | high | Tokens / config / strings via config or env, not literals |
| `use-codegraph-before-refactor` | critical | --callers MUST run before rename/move/extract/delete |
| `commit-discipline` | high | Conventional Commits via commitlint |
| `commit-attribution` | high | AI agents commit as the user — no Co-Authored-By Claude/Codex/Gemini, no `🤖 Generated with` footers |
| `git-discipline` | high | No force-push to main; no skip hooks |
| `pre-commit-discipline` | high | Husky pre-commit hooks must pass |
| `rule-maintenance` | medium | Rules quarterly reviewed; `last-verified` kept fresh |
| `best-practices-2026` | medium | Apply 2026-current patterns; no 2018 idioms |
| `infrastructure-patterns` | medium | Sentinel/Cluster decision, replication, queue topology |
| `modular-backend` | medium | Bounded contexts, no god-services |
| `routing` | medium | Routing conventions (REST / GraphQL / Server Actions) |

| `privacy-pii` | high | No PII in logs, masked outputs, GDPR-compliant retention |
| `observability` | medium | Logs / metrics / traces wired for new services |
| `prototype-to-production` | medium | Hardening checklist before promote |
| `fsd` | medium | Feature-Sliced Design for frontend (when stack matches) |

---

## MCP integrations (real wiring)

Tools wired into agents via `tools:` array in frontmatter:

| MCP | Purpose | Used by |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `mcp-server-context7` | Current library docs (FS / npm / etc.) | All stack-developer agents, best-practices-researcher |
| `playwright` | Browser automation | competitive-design-researcher, e2e tests |
| `mcp-server-figma` | Read Figma designs | ux-ui-designer, prototype-builder |
| `mcp-server-firecrawl` | Web crawling / extraction | competitive-design-researcher, security-researcher |

Skill `evolve:mcp-discovery` — when user task seems to need an external tool, check if an MCP exists before resorting to WebFetch.

---

## Common workflows (orchestrator routing)

When user asks X, route as follows:

| User intent | First action |
|-------------|--------------|
| "Set up a new project" / no `.claude/` exists | `/evolve-genesis` (auto via `/evolve`) |
| "Add feature X" / "implement Y" | `evolve:project-memory` → `evolve:code-search` → relevant stack-developer |
| "Refactor X" / "rename Y" | `evolve:code-search --callers` → `refactoring-specialist` |
| "Why does X happen?" / debug | `root-cause-debugger` (uses `evolve:systematic-debugging`) |
| "Review this code" / "is it safe?" | `code-reviewer` + `security-auditor` |
| "Design X" / "what should the UI look like?" | `ux-ui-designer` then `prototype-builder` |
| "Brand for X" / new product | `creative-director` then `ux-ui-designer` |
| "Architecture for X" / system design | `architect-reviewer` (or stack-architect for known stack) |
| "Performance issue" / "slow X" | `performance-reviewer` (uses profile-first methodology) |
| "DB migration" / "schema change" | `db-reviewer` then `postgres-architect` (or stack-equivalent) |
| "Deploy X" / "infrastructure" | `infrastructure-architect` then `devops-sre` |
| "Plan for X" / specs | `systems-analyst` then `evolve:writing-plans` |
| "Research best X" | relevant `*-researcher` agent (uses context7 MCP) |

Default rule: if user intent isn't clear, invoke `evolve:brainstorming` skill BEFORE picking an agent.

## Plugin development workflow

When adding to this plugin (not to a user's project):

### Adding a new agent

1. Read `agents/_core/code-reviewer.md` as the structural reference
2. Create `agents/<namespace>/<name>.md` with full frontmatter
3. Body must have all 11 sections: Persona / Project Context / Skills / Decision tree / Procedure / Output contract / Anti-patterns / Verification / Common workflows / Out of scope / Related
4. ≥250 lines; persona is 3–4 paragraphs (deep-domain background with concrete past-systems, core principle, priorities, mental model)
5. Add to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `agents:[]` array
6. Run `npm run validate:frontmatter` and `npm run check`

### Adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   name, namespace, description (trigger-clarity format), allowed-tools,
   phase, prerequisites, emits-artifact, confidence-rubric, gate-on-exit,
   version, last-verified
   ```
2. Description MUST start with `Use BEFORE/AFTER/WHEN/ON/WHILE` and contain a `TO <purpose>` clause
3. Body sections: When to invoke / Step 0 — Read source of truth / Decision tree / Procedure / Output contract / Guard rails / Verification / Related
4. Run `npm run lint:descriptions` (validates trigger-clarity)

### Adding a new rule

1. Create `rules/<name>.md` with frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `applies-to`, `severity`, `version`, `last-verified`, `mandatory: true/false`, `related-rules: [...]`)
2. Sections: What / Why / How to apply / When NOT to apply / Discipline / Override / Related
3. Run `npm run validate:frontmatter`

### Adding a new rubric

1. Create `confidence-rubrics/<name>.yaml` matching `confidence-rubrics/_schema.json` (flat dimensions list)
2. Each dimension: `id`, `weight`, `question`, `evidence-required`
3. Sum of weights MUST equal `max-score: 10`
4. Test enforces this — `tests/rubric-schema.test.mjs`

## Validation & checks

Run before claiming work complete:

```bash
npm run check
```

This composes:
1. `validate:plugin-json` — manifest shape + agents:[] paths exist
2. `validate:frontmatter` — every agent / skill / rule has required fields
3. `lint:descriptions` — trigger-clarity format on skills
4. `validate:agent-footers` — every agent's `## Output contract` has Confidence + Rubric lines
5. `validate:design-skills` — every design skill body has feedback prompt + required anti-patterns
6. `validate:question-discipline` — every interactive agent has `## User dialogue discipline` + `asking-multiple-questions-at-once` anti-pattern
7. `lint:dead-code` — knip clean
8. `test` — 253 tests in `tests/*.test.mjs`

Individual scripts:
- `npm run code:index` — full code index rebuild
- `npm run code:search -- --query "..."` / `--callers` / `--top-symbols` — graph queries
- `npm run evolve:status` — comprehensive index health
- `npm run evolve:upgrade` — git pull + lfs + install + check; refreshes upstream-check cache
- `npm run evolve:upgrade-check` — manually query upstream for newer commits (normally runs in background)
- `npm run memory:watch` — start file-watcher daemon
- `npm run registry:build` — regenerate `registry.yaml`
- `npm run migrate:prototype-configs` — backfill `config.json` for legacy prototypes (auto-runs on SessionStart)

## Conventions

- **Commits**: Conventional Commits (enforced by commitlint via Husky `commit-msg` hook)
- **Pre-commit**: Husky + lint-staged run frontmatter / pint / eslint on staged files
- **Pre-push**: Husky + Git LFS pre-push + `npm run check` (253 tests + 8 validators)
- **Imports**: ESM only (`type: "module"` in package.json); use `node:sqlite`, `node:crypto`, etc.
- **File naming**: kebab-case for files; PascalCase for classes inside files
- **Frontmatter**: every agent / skill / rule / rubric file requires it
- **Agents**: ≥250 lines with all 11 standard sections
- **Skills**: trigger-clarity description; phase tag; emits-artifact tag
- **Tests**: `node:test` runner; `*.test.mjs` in `tests/` flat
- **No native deps**: pure JS / WASM / SQLite (built into Node 22+)
- **No Docker**: anywhere in user-facing flow
- **No external services**: all in-process

## Anti-patterns (specific to THIS codebase — incidents fixed once, do not regress)

- **Truncating before embedding** — v1.4.0 incident. Memory was sliced to 800 chars before embedding. Fixed by `chunker.mjs` + `entry_chunks` table. Always embed full chunks, never first-N-chars.
- **Single-language embedding** — pre-1.4.0 used English-only model; broke RU semantic search. multilingual-e5-small is mandatory.
- **`Parser.getLanguage()` on web-tree-sitter v0.26+** — that method was removed. Use `getLanguage(lang)` from grammar-loader and pass to `new Query(language, text)`.
- **`COALESCE` in PRIMARY KEY** — SQLite forbids expressions in PK. Use UNIQUE INDEX with expression instead (see `code_edges`).
- **Skipping graph extraction on hash-unchanged file** — files indexed before D4 had no symbols. `indexFile` now heals via "if no symbols, run extraction even on unchanged hash".
- **Husky 9 deprecation lines** — `#!/usr/bin/env sh` and `. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"` are deprecated. Hook files contain commands only.
- **Force push to main** — never. Use `--force-with-lease` only after local rewrite (e.g., `git lfs migrate import`) and verify origin state matches expectations.
- **>100MB single file in git** — GitHub hard limit. Use Git LFS for `*.onnx`, `*.wasm`. `.gitattributes` already configured.
- **Native bindings** — `node-tree-sitter` requires C compiler at install. We use `web-tree-sitter` (WASM) instead. Never replace.
- **`npm install --no-save` packages then commit `node_modules/`** — only the files copied to `grammars/` go in repo; `node_modules/tree-sitter-*` are dev-time only.

## When in doubt

1. Read this file again — likely answer is here
2. Run `npm run evolve:status` — see real index state
3. Read the specific agent file from `agents/<namespace>/` — they encode the discipline
4. Read the relevant rule from `rules/` — applies-when frontmatter tells when to fire
5. Search memory: `node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/search-memory.mjs --query "<topic>"` — past decisions
6. Search code: `node $CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/search-code.mjs --query "<concept>"` — existing patterns
7. Read `docs/specs/2026-04-27-evolve-framework-design.md` for full architectural rationale

## Reference document templates

Strengthened planning skills reference these templates in `docs/templates/`:

| Template | Used by | Sections required |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| `PRD-template.md` | `evolve:prd` | TL;DR / Problem / Users / Competitive / Goals / Non-goals / Stories / Solution / Risks / Deprecation / Instrumentation / Launch / Open questions |
| `ADR-template.md` | `evolve:adr` | Status / Context / Decision / Alternatives matrix / NFRs / Consequences / Review trigger / Out of scope / Related |
| `plan-template.md` | `evolve:writing-plans` | Goal / Architecture / Files / Critical path / Tasks (TDD steps) / Review gates / Self-review / Handoff |
| `RFC-template.md` | proposals across teams | Summary / Motivation / Design / Drawbacks / Alternatives / Prior art / Unresolved |
| `brainstorm-output-template.md` | `evolve:brainstorming` | Problem / Decomposition / Competitive / Options / Risks / Kill criteria / Matrix / Recommendation |
| `intake-template.md` | `evolve:requirements-intake` | Request / Restated / Personas / Constraints / Success / Out of scope / Stakeholders / Open questions |

These are skeletons — copy-paste and fill in. Skills reference them and verify completeness in their Verification step.
